        """Retrieves a list of resources given the parent resource `id_`.

        Note that due to NodeBB's API, in order to retrieve resources for a
        given parent, we *need* the parent's `slug` along with its `id_`.

        For example, in order to retrieve all topics for a particular category,
        we need the category slug and category id. If the resource `slug` isn't
        supplied, a separate request is made to to retrieve the slug.

        The success tuple contains an iterable:

        >>> from pynodebb import Client
        >>> client = Client('http://localhost:4567', 'master_token')
        >>> status_code, topics = client.topics.list(5)
        >>> for topic in topics:
        ...     print(topic['title'])

        NodeBB provides a way to paginate resources. By default resources are
        paginated by 20 items per page. This can be changed in your NodeBB
        instance's ACP (Admin control panel).

        When `list` has reached the end of the page, it will fetch for the next
        page if one is present.

        Args:
            id_ (int): The id of the parent resource we want to list
                sub-resources for.
            slug (Optional[str]): The resource slug. Defaults to None meaning
                a separate requests is made to fetch the slug.
            start_page (Optional[int]): The page we want the iterable to start at.
                Defaults to the first page if nothing is provided.

        Returns:
            tuple: A tuple in the form (response_code, ResourceIterable)
